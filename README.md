I used sample code and typed along with the video so I could understand javascript.

When I looked at materialize I saw jQuery and decided to just work with javascript because I barely understand it. 

Overall my challenge was understanding functions and calling/adding to the “todo” list.
I am still unclear about functions. 

I don’t fully understand  “parentnode.parentnode”.
